Why Tiny ToCS?
--------------

Tiny ToCS is a forum for high-quality scholarly discourse that challenges researchers to engage with their work in new capacities. Not only does the restricted format require a concise distillation of scholarly results, but the short format will be more accessible to the Computer Science community at large. In fact, to ensure broad applicability, submissions will be reviewed by one area expert and at least two computer scientists outside of the submission's designated research area. Tiny ToCS favors accessible, carefully crafted, creative research.

We invite submissions on a wide range of computer science research, including, but not limited to:

Artificial Intelligence
Computer Architecture
Computer Networking
Computer Systems
Computer Security
Graphics
Human-Computer Interaction
Machine Learning
Programming Languages
Theory of Computation
